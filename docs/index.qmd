Welcome to the documentation site for the PlanetaryPy package. 

- Project repository: <https://github.com/michaelaye/planetarypy>
- API reference (generated): [API Reference](reference/index.qmd)

## About

PlanetaryPy provides utilities and command-line tools for working with planetary data, including PDS index management and SPICE kernel helpers.

## How these docs are organized

This documentation follows the [Diátaxis approach](https://diataxis.fr) with these four major components:

- Tutorials - Lessons that provide a _*learning*_ experience, taking users step-by-step through hands-on exercises to build skills and familiarity.
- How-To Guides - Practical guides focused on providing the steps to solve real-world problems (i.e. _*goal-focused*_).
- Reference - Technical descriptions and factual information about the system, APIs, parameters, etc. (i.e. _*information-focused*_)
- Explanation - Background information and conceptual discussions that provide context and illuminate topics more broadly (i.e. _*understanding-focused*_)

The navigation bar at the top links to these four subsections. 
Sidebars inside these sections enable navigating between documents, and the top right table-of content enables navigation within a document.

API references are generated by [quartodoc](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc) from Python docstrings in the `planetarypy` package.

## Getting started

If you haven't yet installed Quarto and quartodoc, see the build instructions in `qdocs/README.md`.
