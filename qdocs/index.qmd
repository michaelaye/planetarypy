title: PlanetaryPy Documentation (Quarto)
page-layout: article
---

Welcome to the experimental Quarto documentation site for the PlanetaryPy package. This lives in a separate folder (`qdocs/`) so it won't interfere with the existing Sphinx/RST docs in `docs/`.

- Project repository: <https://github.com/michaelaye/planetarypy>
- Existing documentation (RST/Sphinx): see the `docs/` folder in the repo
- API reference (generated): [API Reference](reference/index.qmd)

## About

PlanetaryPy provides utilities and command-line tools for working with planetary data, including PDS index management and SPICE kernel helpers.

## How these docs are organized

- The navigation bar links to the generated API Reference.
- API pages are generated by [quartodoc](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc) from Python docstrings in the `planetarypy` package.
- This site is intentionally minimal and isolated; expand as needed with guides, tutorials, or examples.

## Getting started

If you haven't yet installed Quarto and quartodoc, see the build instructions in `qdocs/README.md`.
